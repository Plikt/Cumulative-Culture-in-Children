## Choosing Diverse Collaborators
Abstract - People’s desire to interact with different others is a significant mediator of the success of diverse teams (Van Knippenberg et. al., 2007; Van Dick et. al., 2008). However, we rarely consider what type of diversity is most often desired by employees, which could be a significant contributor to the unclear results we find in diversity research. To bridge this gap we use the categorization-elaboration model to develop and conduct a study which explores people’s intuitions about ideological, demographic, or experiential diversity. Preliminary results from our first pilot indicate that people believe ideological diversity could lead to the lowest team satisfaction, but that the differences between diversities may not be as significant for the external outcomes of team work. We discuss next steps and implications.
